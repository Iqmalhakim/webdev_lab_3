    <p><b>One of the things that I enjoyed the most during my campus life at UTHM was playing Mobile Legends with my friends in the hostel. 
        It was a great way to relax and de-stress after a long week of classes. We would often play for hours, and we would always have a lot of fun.
        One day, we decided to enter a Mobile Legends tournament. We practiced hard for weeks, and we were determined to win. 
        On the day of the tournament, we were nervous but excited. We knew that we were up against some tough competition, but we were confident in our skills. 
        We played our hearts out, and we managed to reach the finals. In the finals, we faced off against a team from another university. The game was close, but in the end, we emerged victorious. 
        We were overjoyed. We had won the tournament, and we had brought glory to our university. But more importantly, we had created memories that would last a lifetime.</b></p>
